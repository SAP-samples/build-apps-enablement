## Script Overview

This tutorial shows how to use SAP Build Apps to create, stylize a simple, one-page app to SAP BTP.

Specifically, the app lets the user enter sales order details and then send these to an SAP Build Process Automation process for approval. (In a real-world scenario, the sales order would then be created in S/4HANA Cloud, but that is not part of our flow.)

> **Note:** Make sure to exactly follow the exercise documentation and use the provided naming conventions. Otherwise, you will encounter issues.
