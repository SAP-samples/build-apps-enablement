# Module 2: SAP Build Apps  

There are 2 different approaches for this tutorial step.

1. Basic Steps: teaches you about UI components, stylizing them, and organizing them on the page.

> [Create UI by following the tutorial document](./252-1_Create_UI.md) 


2. Import Project: skips the nitty gritty of adding and stylizing components, and instead teaches you how to import an SAP Build Apps project into an existing project. This way is much faster.
